# UPGRADING to 13.02

 * LDAP tree needs to be migrated as a result of https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/91 :
    * ldif export: ldapsearch -xLLL -D "cn=admin,dc=georchestra,dc=org" -W > dump.ldif
    * migration: sed 's/\(memberUid: uid=\)\(.*\)\(,ou=users,dc=georchestra,dc=org\)/memberUid: \2/' dump.ldif > new.ldif
    * ldif import

 * mapfishapp config changes:
    * the print config folder should be moved from YOUR_CONFIG/mapfishapp/print to YOUR_CONFIG/mapfishapp/WEB-INF/print for security reasons, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/82
    * client side (see GEOR_config.js or GEOR_custom.js for more information):
        * MAP_POS_SRS1 and MAP_POS_SRS2 options have been replaced with POINTER_POSITION_SRS_LIST
        * DEFAULT_WMC option has been replaced with CONTEXTS
        * PRINT_LAYOUTS_ACL allows to fine-tune available printing layouts based on user roles
        * DEFAULT_PRINT_FORMAT is now replaced by DEFAULT_PRINT_LAYOUT
        * DEACCENTUATE_REFERENTIALS_QUERYSTRING option added (controls whether to deaccentuate the referentials widget query string or not)
    * server side:
        * There is a new maven filter for mapfishapp temporary documents: shared.mapfishapp.docTempDir (defaults to /tmp/mapfishapp)
    * don't forget to edit your WMCs to activate back buffers on base layers, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/42

 * In GeoNetwork, it is now recommended to use OGC:WMS protocol rather than OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map (or any other WMS tagged with a version) to declare WMS layers, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/4
