# From 18.06 to 19.04

## Datadir upgrade

The datadir has had a great lifting for the release, so the best option is
probably to get a fresh copy of the datadir branch `19.04` and importing the
changes step by step. Many options have been factorized in the datadir's
[default.properties](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir/blob/19.04/default.properties)
file. As a result, this should not be too long for a standard setup !

## LDAP upgrade

With [#2108](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/2108), pending
orgs and users belong to newly introduced Organizational Units. It was indeed
estimated that it would be simpler, since external services might auth users on
`ou=users` or synchronize data from the `ou=orgs` branch, and they would have to
be modified to specialcase the PENDING ones.

As a result, the LDAP DIT should be upgraded with the provided [upgrade from
18.06 to 19.04 LDIF](upgrade_ldap_from_18.06_to_19.04.ldif), which creates two
new Organizational Units for pending users and orgs.

Please note that running a 19.04 console on a 18.06 LDAP will make previously
pending users and orgs considered as registered, valid objects (except that
pending users will not have the required roles to log in). It is thus
recommended to discard them (or validate them) before doing the transition to
19.04.

## Database

No model changes between 18.06 and 19.04

## Frontend / Reverse Proxy

Mapfishapp is able to display local files (SHP, KML ...) on the map. To do this,
the file is uploaded to the mapfishapp backend and streamed to the client as
GeoJSON. The maximum size of these file can be defined in the
[datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir/blob/19.04/mapfishapp/mapfishapp.properties#L23),
but in certain cases, the Apache2 proxy could be more restrictive if the
[`LimitRequestBody`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html#request-bodies)
had been set to a lower limit. For a normal usage, you don't need to set the
`LimitRequestBody`.
